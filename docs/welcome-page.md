# Frequently Asked Questions

::: details What will happen to `ðŸ”’ I Like Android Privacy`?
The website will still be available for now, and you can also view all the previous stuff moved over to this site in the `ARCHIVE` section on the sidebar.
:::
::: details Why the change?
In my opinion, `ðŸ”’ I Like Android Privacy` was a good idea, but the process I had to go through to find apps that are privacy focussed and useful was exhausting. This however makes it a lot easier, I will not focus on privacy as much (to an extent, if something is straight up malware you will not find it here) but will still ensure the safety of whomever may use this.

::: details Can I contribute to this?
**Yes!**... eventually. Not yet, but stay tuned!
