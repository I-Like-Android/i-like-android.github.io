## Guide for AdGuard

* Download the latest version of `AdGuard Premium` from the link featured above.
* Once it has installed, open the app and go to `Settings -> Filtering -> Filters` and enable each one you want. I recommend enabling all 3 of the `Ad filters`. I also don't recommend enabling `HTTPS filtering`, as it could cause issues with some sites.
* Go back to the home page, click the button in the middle to enable `AdGuard`, you will get a pop up asking to allow `AdGuard` to work as a VPN, make sure you allow it.
* And that's it! Now you have `AdGuard` running on your system!
